# QGIS Plugins, by Luís Valença Pinto
QGIS plugins developed as part of research and applied work at the [Environmental Management Research Laboratory](https://www.mruni.eu/en/research/mru-laboratories/environmental-management-laboratory/) (**MRU.ES.res.lab.**) ([Mykolas Romeris University](https://www.mruni.eu/en/), Vilnius, Lithuania), focused on spatial analysis and environmental assessment.

Each tool is designed with a focus on practical use, efficient processing, and an intuitive user experience (UX) combined with clear, appealing interfaces (UI).

# 🌍 Ecosystem & Environmental Tools
### ✨ Ecosystem Condition — 🔧 In development
A comprehensive tool to calculate the ecosystem condition of a landscape, based on user-selected variables related to different ecosystem states (physical, chemical, compositional, structural, functional, and landscape states). Currently being developed under the [SELINA research project](https://project-selina.eu/) (EU Horizon Grant No. 101060415). 

# 🧰 General Tools
### 🌐 Euclidean Distance Tool — 🔧 In development
Computes Euclidean distance from selected features or raster masks.

### 🌍 Align Raster Layers — 🔧 In development
Automatically aligns a set of rasters to a reference layer, unifying extent, CRS, resolution, and grid.

### ⚫ Uniform noData Values — 🔧 In development
Applies a consistent noData value across multiple raster layers.

### 📊 Check Multicollinearity — 🔧 In development
Assesses correlation and variance inflation factor (VIF) between raster layers.

### ⚖️ Normalise Rasters — 🔧 In development
Normalises raster layers using reference thresholds, resampling, clipping, and masking options.

### 🔹 Raster Tools — 🔧 In development
Bundle plugin integrating:
* Euclidean Distance
* Align Rasters
* Uniform noData
* Multicollinearity Check
* Raster Normalisation

# 📆 Roadmap
* Finalise core features of the Ecosystem Condition assessment tool
* Finalise and publish Raster Tools and sub-tools independently
* Add installation instructions and screenshots for each plugin

# 👤 About the Author
Researcher in environmental sciences and QGIS plugin developer with a solid background in spatial planning and graphic design.
I combine a hands-on approach as a power user with a designer’s mindset, focused on delivering efficient, intuitive (UX), and visually engaging (UI) geospatial tools.

My time as a PhD student and current work at the [MRU.EM.res.lab.](https://www.mruni.eu/en/research/mru-laboratories/environmental-management-laboratory/) have deepened my expertise in both environmental and social sciences, while driving me to create practical, user-friendly tools to support my team’s workflows.
