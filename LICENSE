Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license 
for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed 
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, 
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom 
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains 
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use 
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies 
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply 
it to your programs, too.

measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under

[...]

1. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
